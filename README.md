TODO:
- add live score update feature
- figure out how to make this appeal to women (potentially add tv show release schedules?)
- MMA would get Karan on board 
- CFB/CBB (need to select a subset of all colleges to support)
- payment system, $0.99/month for premium
- compatible with apple calendar 👀 other calendar apps too?
- Hide spoilers feature where the score doesn’t update until 24hrs after the game incase you want to catch the replay (inspired by mlb.tv lol)
- if creating >600 events, send user confirmation email and then notification when calendar is ready kinda like how gametime does when buying tickets. limit is 600 req/min so keep a pace of 300 req/min to start
- add tv network details 
- TESTING FRAMEWORK
- settings page for premium users to enable/disable any premium feature
