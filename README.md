- MMA would get Karan on board 
- CFB/CBB (need to select a subset of all colleges to support)
- payment system, $0.99/month for premium
- compatible with apple calendar üëÄ other calendar apps too?
- Hide spoilers feature where the score doesn‚Äôt update until 24hrs after the game incase you want to catch the replay (inspired by mlb.tv lol)
- change event creation to be 10 requests at a time and use exponential backoff for throttling, send user confirmation email and then notification when calendar is ready kinda like how gametime does when buying tickets. limit is 600 req/min so keep a pace of 300 req/min to start
