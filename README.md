- payment system, $0.99/month for premium
- compatible with apple calendar üëÄ other calendar apps too?
- Hide spoilers feature where the score doesn‚Äôt update until 24hrs after the game incase you want to catch the replay (inspired by mlb.tv lol)
- if creating >600 events, send user confirmation email and then notification when calendar is ready kinda like how gametime does when buying tickets. limit is 600 req/min so keep a pace of 300 req/min to start
